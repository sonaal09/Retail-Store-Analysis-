# Walmart Analytics Project

This project focuses on analyzing Walmart sales data to help managers understand store performance and support decision-making on inventory at a state level.

Project Overview

Data Cleaning & Preparation: Used Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy to clean and prepare the dataset.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explored the dataset to generate insights that highlight store performance and customer trends.

Visualization & Dashboard: Built an interactive dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly to present results in a clear and dynamic way.

# Key KPIs & Insights

The main performance indicators I focused on include:

Total Sales

Total Revenue

Average Rating

Total Transactions

These KPIs provide managers with a quick overview of overall performance.

Visualizations in the Dashboard

Some of the main charts and tables created include:

Units Sold by Category: Compared performance across categories such as Fashion, Home & Lifestyle, and Electronics.

Payment Method Analysis: Showed the percentage of transactions by e-wallet, credit card, and cash.

Sales by Category: Displayed total sales and transactions by product category.

Revenue by Month: Identified monthly and seasonal trends.

Quantity vs Revenue: Examined how sales volume related to revenue generation.

Correlation Heatmap: Highlighted relationships between key variables.

Filters: Added advanced filters to explore results by city and year.

Tables were also included so managers can view data in detail and download reports for offline use.
